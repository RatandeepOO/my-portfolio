            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>
                I began my journey as a self-taught Python developer, creating small automation scripts and learning the fundamentals of software development. Over time, I developed a keen interest in machine learning and AI, which led me to explore deep learning, natural language processing, and voice recognition technologies. My projects range from personal assistants to smart home systems, and I continue to experiment with cutting-edge technologies to stay ahead in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working on several exciting projects, including a voice-controlled personal assistant and an IoT-based smart home control system. These projects not only expand my technical knowledge but also help me understand the real-world applications of AI and IoT.
